# Architecture Decision Records

This directory stores the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the CatVox project.

ADRs capture important technical and architectural decisions in a lightweight, versioned, reviewable form. They help explain not just *what* was decided, but *why*.

## Purpose

Use ADRs to record decisions such as:

- architecture and infrastructure choices
- security and identity approaches
- data storage and lifecycle decisions
- platform and framework selections
- major trade-offs affecting future development

## Rules

- One ADR per decision.
- ADRs are immutable records of decisions made at a point in time.
- If a decision changes later, create a new ADR that supersedes the earlier one rather than rewriting history.
- Keep ADRs short, concrete, and focused on the decision and its consequences.
- ADRs live in Git and should be reviewed through normal pull requests.

## Naming Convention

Files use a numeric prefix followed by a short kebab-case title:

- `0001-use-adr.md`
- `0002-...`

The numbering is sequential and permanent.

## Suggested Template

Each ADR should usually contain:

- Title
- Status
- Date
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Supersedes / Superseded by (when relevant)

## Workflow

1. Create a new numbered ADR when a meaningful technical or architectural decision is made.
2. Review it in the same PR as the related design or implementation change where possible.
3. Mark the ADR status clearly.
4. If a later decision replaces it, create a new ADR and cross-reference both records.
