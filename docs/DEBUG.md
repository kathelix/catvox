# CatVox AI — Backend Debugging Guide

This document covers how to diagnose backend failures that surface to the user
as a generic error screen in the app as "Upload failed. The operation couldn't be completed. (NSURLErrorDomain error -1011.)", and how to move beyond manual log triage to proactive observability.

---

## 1. The Symptom

The user sees a failure screen. The iOS app knows the HTTP status code (500,
429, etc.) but has no access to the server-side root cause. The root cause
lives in Cloud Run logs.

---

## 2. Manual Debugging Workflow

### Step 1 — Get a quick overview of recent errors

```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
   AND resource.labels.service_name=("getSignedUploadURL" OR "analysevideo")
   AND severity>=ERROR' \
  --project=kathelix-catvox-prod \
  --limit=50 \
  --freshness=1h \
  --format='table(timestamp, resource.labels.service_name, severity, textPayload)'
```

**What this does:** queries Cloud Logging for ERROR or CRITICAL entries from
both Cloud Run services in the last hour, formatted as a table.

**Notes:**
- GCP lowercases service names in logs — use `analysevideo`, not `analyseVideo`.
- `--freshness` accepts `1h`, `30m`, `24h`, etc. Widen it if the incident was older.
- `resource.type="cloud_run_revision"` is correct for Firebase Functions 2nd gen,
  which run on Cloud Run.

---

### Step 2 — Get the full payload of a specific error

The table view truncates long messages. Use `--format=json` and pipe through
Python to pretty-print:

```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
   AND resource.labels.service_name="analysevideo"
   AND severity=ERROR' \
  --project=kathelix-catvox-prod \
  --limit=5 \
  --freshness=1h \
  --format=json \
| python3 -c "
import json, sys
for e in json.load(sys.stdin):
    print('--- TIME:', e.get('timestamp'))
    print('SEVERITY:', e.get('severity'))
    p = e.get('textPayload') or e.get('jsonPayload') or e.get('protoPayload', {})
    print('PAYLOAD:', json.dumps(p, indent=2) if isinstance(p, dict) else p)
    print()
"
```

**What this does:** fetches the 5 most recent errors in full JSON and extracts
the relevant payload fields.

For the malformed-Vertex hotfix path specifically, query both the retry warning
and the final controlled error:

```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
   AND resource.labels.service_name="analysevideo"
   AND severity>=WARNING
   AND (
     jsonPayload.message="Retrying malformed Vertex AI analysis payload"
     OR jsonPayload.message="Vertex AI returned malformed analysis payload"
   )' \
  --project=kathelix-catvox-prod \
  --limit=50 \
  --freshness=24h \
  --format=json
```

**How to read it:**
- `attempt: 1` warning = first Gemini response was malformed and the backend retried.
- `attempt: 2` warning followed by the final error = both attempts were malformed and the request returned a controlled HTTP `502`.
- `issues` tells you whether the failure was truncated / invalid JSON or missing / invalid required fields.
- `rawResponsePreview` gives the start of the bad model output without dumping the full payload into logs.

**Important:** this hotfix no longer relies on an unhandled exception for this
failure mode. Debug it from Cloud Logging, not from expecting the same Error
Reporting email path as a crashing `500`.

---

### Step 3 — Correlate a specific request end-to-end

If you know roughly when the failure occurred, pull all log lines (not just
errors) for that time window to see the full request lifecycle:

```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
   AND resource.labels.service_name=("getSignedUploadURL" OR "analysevideo")
   AND timestamp>="2026-04-21T05:35:00Z"
   AND timestamp<="2026-04-21T05:37:00Z"' \
  --project=kathelix-catvox-prod \
  --format='table(timestamp, resource.labels.service_name, severity, textPayload)'
```

Replace the timestamps with the window around the failure (visible in Xcode
console from the iOS Logger output).

---

### Step 4 — Check for cold-start contributions

A new Cloud Run instance being spun up adds ~3–5 s of latency. Look for
`Starting new instance` entries in the same window:

```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
   AND textPayload:"Starting new instance"' \
  --project=kathelix-catvox-prod \
  --limit=20 \
  --freshness=6h \
  --format='table(timestamp, resource.labels.service_name, textPayload)'
```

---

### Step 5 — Check the GCS upload bucket directly

If the failure is at the upload stage (iOS PUT to GCS), verify whether the
object landed:

```bash
gcloud storage ls -l gs://catvox-raw-videos-kathelix-catvox-prod/
```

If the object is absent, the signed URL upload itself failed. If it is present,
the failure was downstream (Vertex AI call).

---

## 3. Known Error Signatures

| Log message | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Vertex AI returned invalid JSON: { "primary_emotion": ...` (truncated) | `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` too low — thinking model consumed budget before finishing JSON | Raise `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` in `functions/src/gemini.ts` |
| `Retrying malformed Vertex AI analysis payload` then `Vertex AI returned malformed analysis payload` | Gemini returned malformed output twice; backend converted it to a controlled `502` instead of crashing | Inspect `issues`, `attempt`, and `rawResponsePreview` in logs; if frequent, revisit prompt / output constraints or `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` |
| `Empty response from Vertex AI` | Response had only `thought` parts, no output part | Check `finishReason` in the error summary; may indicate safety block or token exhaustion |
| `signBlob` permission denied | Cloud Run running as wrong service account | Verify `serviceAccount:` is set in both function options; redeploy |
| GCS PUT returns HTTP 403 | `catvox-backend-sa` missing `storage.objectCreator` | Check IAM bindings via `gcloud projects get-iam-policy` |
| `Daily scan limit reached` (HTTP 429) | Expected — user hit the 5-scan/day cap | Not a bug; visible in app as quota exceeded screen |
| `service agents being provisioned` | Vertex AI service agent not yet granted bucket access | Wait and retry; persistent → check `google_storage_bucket_iam_member.vertexai_sa_raw_videos_viewer` in Terraform |

---

## 4. Observability Options

The manual workflow above requires someone to notice a failure, then dig into
logs reactively. Below are the options for moving to proactive detection.

---

### Option A — Cloud Monitoring log-match alert (implemented in IaC)

A Cloud Monitoring alerting policy fires directly on ERROR-level log entries
from either Cloud Function, with no manual console steps required.

**This is already implemented in `terraform/monitoring.tf`.** Add your email
to `terraform.tfvars` and the next `terraform apply` (or CI merge) activates it:

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
alert_email = "you@example.com"
```

**What you get:** an email within ~1 minute of any unhandled exception, with a
link to the alert and the documentation note pointing to `docs/DEBUG.md`.
Rate-limited to one email per 5 minutes to prevent alert storms.

**Important:** the malformed-Vertex hotfix in `analysevideo` now returns a
handled `502` with application logs instead of an unhandled exception, so do
not assume this specific failure mode will arrive via the same email path.

**What the alert email contains:** timestamp, service name, link to Cloud
Logging filtered to the error window, and the documentation snippet from
`monitoring.tf`. From there, run the Step 2 command in §2 to get the full
payload.

**Limitation:** one email per alert wave, not per individual error. For
per-error detail you still need `gcloud logging read` (§2).

---

### Option B — Cloud Monitoring alert on 5xx rate (built-in metrics)

Cloud Run exports `run.googleapis.com/request_count` broken down by
`response_code_class`. A Cloud Monitoring alerting policy can fire when the
5xx rate exceeds a threshold.

```bash
# Create an alert policy via gcloud (or use the GCP Console UI)
gcloud monitoring policies create \
  --notification-channels=CHANNEL_ID \
  --display-name="CatVox analyseVideo 5xx spike" \
  --condition-display-name="5xx > 5% of requests over 5 min" \
  --condition-filter='resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
    AND resource.labels.service_name="analysevideo"
    AND metric.type="run.googleapis.com/request_count"
    AND metric.labels.response_code_class="5xx"' \
  --condition-threshold-value=0.05 \
  --condition-threshold-duration=300s \
  --condition-aggregations-aligner=ALIGN_RATE \
  --condition-comparison=COMPARISON_GT
```

**What you get:** alert on the symptom (elevated error rate), not the root
cause. Good as a catch-all. Pair with Option A to get the "why".

**Notification channels** (create first in Cloud Monitoring → Alerting →
Notification channels): email, Slack webhook, PagerDuty, OpsGenie.

---

### Option C — Log-based metric + alert (most targeted)

Create a metric that counts log lines matching `severity=ERROR` in the
Cloud Functions services, then alert on it. More targeted than Option B
because it fires on application errors, not just HTTP 5xx.

```bash
# 1. Create a log-based metric
gcloud logging metrics create catvox_function_errors \
  --description="Unhandled errors in CatVox Cloud Functions" \
  --log-filter='resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
    AND resource.labels.service_name=("getSignedUploadURL" OR "analysevideo")
    AND severity=ERROR'

# 2. Create an alerting policy on it (via Console: Monitoring → Alerting → Create policy)
#    Metric: logging.googleapis.com/user/catvox_function_errors
#    Condition: count > 0 over 5-minute rolling window
```

This is the recommended baseline for a small production service.

---

### Option D — Expose root cause to the iOS app (developer experience)

The iOS app currently receives `HTTP 500` with no body when an unhandled error
occurs. Adding a structured error body allows the iOS `Logger` to print the
root cause directly in Xcode, eliminating the need to open `gcloud` for
development-time failures.

**Backend change** (`functions/src/analyse.ts`):

```typescript
// Wrap the Vertex AI call in a catch that returns a structured error body
try {
  const rawJson = await callGemini(projectId, gcsUri);
  // ... parse and return
} catch (err: unknown) {
  const message = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err);
  // Only include detail in non-production, or always — the message contains
  // no user data and no secrets; it is safe to surface.
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Analysis failed', detail: message });
  return;
}
```

**iOS change** (`GCPService.swift`, in `triggerAnalysis`):

```swift
guard (200...299).contains(http.statusCode) else {
    let body = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) ?? "(no body)"
    logger.error("analyseVideo: HTTP \(http.statusCode) — \(body)")
    throw URLError(.badServerResponse)
}
```

The `detail` field from the server lands in Xcode's console via `logger.error`,
giving the exact Vertex AI error message without opening a terminal.

**Limitation:** this is a developer-experience improvement, not a production
alerting solution. It does not notify anyone proactively — you still need to
be running the app with Xcode attached to see it.

---

### Option E — Firebase Crashlytics non-fatal reporting

Integrate Firebase Crashlytics (already in the Firebase project) into the iOS
app. When `analyseVideo` returns a non-2xx response, log a non-fatal event with
the status code and any error detail from the response body.

```swift
// In GCPService.swift after receiving a non-2xx from analyseVideo:
import FirebaseCrashlytics
Crashlytics.crashlytics().record(
    error: NSError(
        domain: "com.kathelix.catvox.backend",
        code: http.statusCode,
        userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: body]
    )
)
```

**What you get:** every backend failure recorded in the Firebase Crashlytics
dashboard with device context, iOS version, and frequency across all users.
Crashlytics sends email digests and can be configured to alert on new issue
types.

**Limitation:** only captures what the server sends back. Pair with a
structured error response (Option D) to get the full root cause into
Crashlytics.

---

## 5. Recommendation

For the current stage of CatVox (single developer, low user volume):

| Priority | Action | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **Do now** | Enable GCP Error Reporting email alerts (Option A) | 5 min, no code |
| **Do now** | Add structured error body to `analyseVideo` + log in iOS (Option D) | 30 min, two files |
| **Soon** | Add log-based metric alert (Option C) | 20 min, one gcloud command |
| **When users grow** | Integrate Firebase Crashlytics (Option E) | ~2 hours, SDK + wiring |

Options A + D together give the shortest path from "user sees error" to "engineer
knows root cause" — Error Reporting alerts the engineer proactively, and the
structured response means the root cause is available in Xcode during
development without any log triage.
