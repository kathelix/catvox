# PostHog setup report

PostHog analytics are integrated through the repo-owned XcodeGen workflow.
The SDK package is declared in `project.yml`, app configuration is generated
into `Info.plist`, and runtime calls go through `AnalyticsService` instead of
direct `PostHogSDK.shared.capture(...)` calls in views.

Analytics identify the user with CatVox's existing anonymous per-install UUID
from `UserIdentityStore`, matching the identifier used for quota enforcement.
If the PostHog project token is missing, analytics are disabled without
crashing the app. Analytics are also disabled during XCTest and SwiftUI previews
to keep automated verification out of production dashboards.

CatVox uses explicit product events only. PostHog automatic lifecycle capture,
screen-view capture, element autocapture, rage-click capture, surveys, session
replay, feature-flag preloading, default person properties, and crash autocapture
are disabled in `AnalyticsService`.

These dashboard definitions may need to be refreshed because `scan_shared` now
means a completed share action, while `share_sheet_opened` tracks sheet
presentation.

## Dashboard Refresh Notes

Refresh the wizard-created PostHog insights so they match CatVox's final event
semantics:

1. Open each linked insight from **Dashboard - Analytics basics**.
2. For share-sheet presentation counts, use `share_sheet_opened`.
3. For completed share counts, use `scan_shared`.
4. For save-to-Photos success counts, use `scan_saved_to_photos`.
5. For failure monitoring, use `share_export_render_failed`,
   `share_save_failed`, and `photos_permission_denied`.
6. Save the edited insight and update the dashboard tile title if the event
   meaning changed.

Suggested MVP dashboard tiles:

- Scan conversion funnel:
  `scan_source_chosen` -> `video_validation_passed` -> `analysis_completed`.
- Photos import validation:
  trend of `video_validation_failed` grouped by `validation_failure_reason`.
- Share conversion funnel:
  `share_export_started` -> `share_sheet_opened` -> `scan_shared`.
- Save-to-Photos conversion:
  `share_export_started` -> `scan_saved_to_photos`.
- Quota pressure:
  trend of `quota_card_shown` grouped by `trigger`, with `upgrade_to_pro_tapped`
  as the conversion event.
